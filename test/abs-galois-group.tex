1. the absolute Galois group G_K of a field K is Gal(K^sep/K) 
i.e. the Galois group of K^sep over K, where K^sep is a separable closure of K.

2. When K is a perfect field, K^sep is the same as an algebraic closure K^alg of K. 
This holds e.g. for K of characteristic zero, or K a finite field. 

3. The absolute Galois group of a finite field K is isomorphic to the group
\hat{\mathbf{Z}} := lim_\larr \mathbf{Z}/n\mathbf{Z}. 

4. G_\Q := Gal(\bar\Q/\Q), where \bar\Q or \bar Q is the algebraic closure of 
the field of rational numbers i.e. the field of algebraic numbers.
