\definition-\lemma. Let $F$ be a subfield of a field $L$. An element $a \in L$ is called 
algebraic over $F$ if one of the following equivalent conditions is satisfied 
  (1) $f(a) = 0$ for a non-zero polynomial $f(X) \in F[X]$
  (2) elements $1, a, a^2, \cdots$ are linearly dependent over $F$
  (3) F-vector space $F[a] = \{ \sum a_ka^k : a_k \in F \}$ is of finite dimension over $F$
  (4) $F[a] = F(a)$

\proof. Omitted.

  For an element a algebraic over F denote by
                                f_a(X) \in F[X]
the monic polynomial of minimal degree such that f_a(a) = 0. 
  This polynomial is irreducible. f_a(X) is a linear polynomial iff a \in F.

\lemma. Define a ring homomorphism F[X] \rarr L, g(X) \rarr g(a). Its kernel is the
  principal ideal generated by f_a(X) and its image is F(a), so
                              F[X]/(f_a(X)) \cong F(a)
\proof. Using the division algorithm.
                            
\definition. A field L is called algebraic over its subfield F if every element of L is
algebraic over F. The extension L/F is called algebraic. 

\definition. Let F be a subfield of a field L. The dimension of L as a vector space
over F is called the degree [L : F] of the extension L/F.

  If a is algebraic over F then [F(a) : F] is finite and it equals the degree of the
monic irreducible polynomial fa of a over F.
