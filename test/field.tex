  \S 1. Finite fields. Let F be a field (commutative or not) with the
unit-element 1. Its characteristic must clearly be a prime p > 1, 
prime ring in F is isomorphic to the prime field \mathbf F_p = \mathbf Z/p\mathbf Z, with 
which we may identify it. Then F may be regarded as a vector-space over \mathbf F_p;  
as such, it has an obviously finite dimension n, and the number of its 
elements is q = p^n. 

\theorem (Wedderburn). All finite fields are commutative.
