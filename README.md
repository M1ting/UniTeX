## In-progress

- **Some basic or commonly used macro commands**. ideally including but not limited to the functions in [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) and [KaTeX](https://katex.org), They have some differences in the supported macros. This project will prefer the latter design (i.e. 
[Supported Functions](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html)).

- **A website convenient for input and output**. 

- **Additional unicode characters** and corresponding macro commands ([BabelMap](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Unicode/babelmap.html)). 

## Future

- **The output is syntactically compatible with [AsciiMath](http://asciimath.org)**, 
which may be used as the default style or an optional setting.
